This is the program that should be installed run on the Raspberry Pi.

You can also run the app on your computer. This is the preferred approach  
for development since it is faster and more efficient to edit/run/test code 
without having to deploy each time on the Pi.

To run locally, do the following:

1. If needed, install Python 2.7 on your machine.

2. Install the Flask package

   pip install flask
   
3. Open a terminal console and go to the rasman/ folder

   cd rasman
   
4. Run the app

   python main.py
   
5. Fire up your browser and go to:

   http://localhost:5000
   
   Login as user 'admin', password is also 'admin'.
   

For more info see, the documents under the doc/ folder (still work in progress).
